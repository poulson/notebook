<h2>What am I up to?</h2>
Jack's time is currently largely split between preparing <a href="https://github.com/elemental/Elemental/commits/master">version 0.86 of Elemental</a>, teaching <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~poulson/courses/ATiNLA15/">Advanced Topics in Numerical Linear Algebra</a>, and starting up a research group. He is currently excited about Elemental finally supporting distributed sparse Interior Point 
Methods for quadratic programs and distributed sparse nonsymmetric 
direct linear solves.

<h2>An experiment in informal notes</h2>
While it is difficult for me to conclude that this experiment was anything but
a failure, largely due to the high auxiliary time overheads of both starting up a research group and significantly extending Elemental's capabilities, as well
as the confidentiality inherent in peer review, hopefully I can learn how to 
make time for more frequent posts.
