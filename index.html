<h2>What am I up to?</h2>
For the beginning of the Spring quarter, Jack's time is largely split between 
finalizing the release of <a href="https://github.com/elemental/Elemental/commits/master">version 0.86 of Elemental</a>, teaching <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~poulson/courses/MitRW15/">Mathematics in the Real World</a>, and slowly starting up a research group. 
He is currently excited about Elemental finally supporting distributed 
sparse-direct Interior Point Methods for quadratic programs, distributed 
sparse-direct generalized least squares problems, and distributed 
sparse-direct nonsymmetric linear solves (and he now has a newfound 
appreciation for equilibration and quad-precision arithmetic).

<h2>An experiment in informal notes</h2>
While it is difficult for me to conclude that this experiment was anything but
a failure, largely due to the high auxiliary time overheads of both starting up a research group and significantly extending Elemental's capabilities, as well
as the confidentiality inherent in peer review, hopefully I can learn how to 
make time for more frequent posts.
