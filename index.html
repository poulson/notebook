<h2>What am I up to?</h2>
Jack is currently teaching two sections of <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/math53/">Linear Algebra with Differential Equations]</a>, and his research is currently focused on several aspects of the development of <a href="https://github.com/elemental/Elemental">Elemental</a>, such as unifying the various distributed dense data structures in preparation for the introduction of two-dimensional plus low-rank sparse matrix distributions to lift the barrier to scalability inn the library's recently introduced distributed sparse Interior Point Methods 
(for Linear, Quadratic, and Second-Order Cone Programs). He is also working 
with several teams on exposing higher-level interfaces and functionality (e.g., through <a href="https://github.com/JuliaParallel/Elemental.jl">Elemental.jl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy">CVXPY</a>, <a href="https://smallk.github.io/">SmallK</a>, <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5131">Skylark</a>, and <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/">PETSc</a>).
