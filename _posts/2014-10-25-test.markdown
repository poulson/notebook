The [Innovative Computing Laboratory](http://www.icl.utk.edu/about) is currently celebrating its 
25 year anniversary and was kind enough to give me this souvenir on my visit yesterday:

I had the opportunity to give a talk on 
[high-performance schemes for computing pseudospectra](http://libelemental.org/pub/slides/UTenn-El-Oct24-2014.pdf) 
and was surprised to see both how large the group is and how many active research projects there are.
I hope to hear more about their recent work on decentralized schedulers for 
distributed-memory linear algebra soon.
