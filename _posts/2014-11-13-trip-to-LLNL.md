I spent the day visiting the [Rob Falgout](http://people.llnl.gov/falgout2) 
and the rest of the [Computational Mathematics group](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/computational-mathematics-group.php), which is currently led by 
[Ulrike Yang](http://people.llnl.gov/yang11).

They were kind enough to listen to me [speak about Elemental]({{ site.baseurl }}/slides/LLNL-El-Nov12-2014.pdf), despite the fact that their group primarily 
focuses on distributed-memory multigrid methods and high-order Lagrangian 
finite-element methods. Otherwise, Ulrike and I had a very detailed discussion
about my current views on the competitiveness of structured
matrix techniques relative to multigrid on tens of thousands of processors 
(I am not as bullish as everyone seems to assume).

I promised to help organize a workshop at Stanford some time during the Winter 
quarter on multigrid methods, and so hopefully I don't fall through on my
promise.

### NOTE (Monday, January 5, 2015):
Due to spending my last month [deeply involved within the development of 
distributed sparse-direct interior point methods for Linear and Quadratic 
Programming](https://github.com/elemental/Elemental/commits/master), some time
passed before I updated this website. I hope to become active again soon now 
that my head is again above water.
