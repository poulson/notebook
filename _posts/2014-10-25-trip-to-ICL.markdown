The [Innovative Computing Laboratory](http://www.icl.utk.edu/about) is currently celebrating its 
25 year anniversary and was kind enough to give me this souvenir on my visit yesterday:

In particular, it was great to have my first real conversation with 
[Jack Dongarra](http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/), as well as 
to have detailed discussions with members of his research group, such as 
[George Bosilca](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/~bosilca/), 
[Jakub Kurzak](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~kurzak/) and 
[Piotr Luszczek](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~luszczek/) on 
distributed scheduling and [PaRSEC](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/parsec/), and
[Stanimire Tomov](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~tomov/) and 
[Mark Gates](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~mgates3/) on 
GPU-accelerated DLA and [MAGMA](http://icl.eecs.utk.edu/magma/).

I had the opportunity to give a talk on 
[high-performance schemes for computing pseudospectra]({{ site.baseurl }}/slides/UTenn-El-Oct24-2014.pdf) 
and was surprised to see both how large the group is and how many active 
research projects there are.
I hope to hear more about their recent work on decentralized schedulers for 
distributed-memory linear algebra soon.
