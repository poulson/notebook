I have started this site for a number of reasons:

1. I have recently moved from Georgia Tech to Stanford
2. I would like to keep a public journal of some of my academic activities

I have chosen this format since it is static HTML, so I can easily maintain
the website with a simple text editor on my laptop and publish it anywhere.
Furthermore, [Jekyll][jekyll] supports both LaTeX and C++ code snippets.

$$ e^{\pi i} = -1  $$

{% highlight C++ %}
template<typename T>
void Foo( T value )
{ std::cout << value << std::endl; }
{% endhighlight %}
