title: Conflicts of Interest
permalink: /COI/
---

Given how easily the lines between academic and industry work can be blurred,
especially when deliverables are produced as part of research, I prefer to
keep my potential conflicts of interest publicly declared. My current and 
pending sources of funding are:

* Stanford University,
* The National Science Foundation, and
* The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Furthermore, I have previously been supported by:

* The Georgia Institute of Technology,
* The University of Texas at Austin,
* Schlumberger,
* Argonne National Laboratory, and
* Microsoft.

But, more realistically, and perhaps controversially, my largest potential 
conflict of interest is that my current position is up for renewal in a few 
years. Thus, my current position is indirectly tied to the opinions of a small 
group of researchers, and it would be a lie to say that this fact does not at 
least give me pause before voicing public opinions.
