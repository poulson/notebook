The best place to find me is on the fourth floor of 
[Sloan Hall](http://mathematics.stanford.edu/about/department-location/)
in Office 384Y. Otherwise, I can be usually be found on the second floor
of [ICME](http://icme.stanford.edu), which is located in the basement of the
Huang Engineering Center. If in doubt, it is best to 
[email me](mailto:poulson@stanford.edu) beforehand.
