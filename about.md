His research interests tend to focus on distributed-memory algorithms and 
software for modern numerical algorithms, with focuses on 
[direct linear algebra and optimization](http://libelemental.org) and schemes 
for applying hierarchical low-rank techniques as broadly as possible 
(e.g., structured matrices and [butterfly algorithms](http://github.com/poulson/dist-butterfly)).
