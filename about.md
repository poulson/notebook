Jack Poulson is an 
[Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Stanford University](http://mathematics.stanford.edu/people/name/jack/) and 
[Member of the Institute for Computational Engineering and Mathematics](http://icme.stanford.edu/people/jack-poulson).
His research tends to focus on distributed-memory algorithms and 
software for modern numerical algorithms, with concentrations on 
[direct linear algebra and optimization](http://libelemental.org) and algebra
on/with structured matrices
(e.g., $$ \mathcal{H} $$-matrices and [butterfly algorithms](http://github.com/poulson/dist-butterfly)).
He has recently been focusing on distributed-memory sparse-direct 
Interior Point Methods and has recently released software for both [direct and
affine conic form Linear and Quadratic Programs](https://github.com/elemental/Elemental/commit/6bafd25173672a92791832e5397898ad36aff7cd).
